# Introduction

## Why Jest Preview

When writing tests using Jest, we usually debug by reading the HTML code. Sometimes the HTML is too complicated and it's hard to imagine how the UI looks in our head. `jest-preview` initiates a server and serve your HTML in a browser, then you can see your actual UI visually. This way, it helps you debug jest tests faster.

`jest-preview` is initially design to work with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). However it's framework-agnostic and you can use it with any testing libraries.

## Online Demo

You can try Jest Preview right on the browser without installing or cloning anything, thanks to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/):
